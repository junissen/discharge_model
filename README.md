# discharge_model
Python model that loops over model parameters to determine approximate discharge for MWP-1a.

Models replicate that conducted in Carlson, 2009. d18O of ice is varied from -12.5 parts per mille to -25.5 parts per mille. d18O of precipitation is varied from -5 parts per mille to -9 parts per mille. To run discharge model for benthic and planktonic d18O anamolies, run discharge_run.py. To estimate meltwater in equivalent sea level rise, run meltwater_estimate.py.
